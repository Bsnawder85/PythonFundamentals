# PythonFundamentals
Python is my first programming language, which I learned in college. For this course, I am refreshing myself in the basics before/while I learn more advanced topics and Python frameworks.
Learning topics include: OOP, Error Handling, Modules, HTTP Requests with JSON, Iterators, Generators, Decorators, Testing, File IO, working with CSV files and Pickling, Web Scraping, and working with SQL.
